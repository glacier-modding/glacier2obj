`glacier2obj` provides functionality to search for mesh collision (ALOC) files with a Glacier scene from the Hitman games.

## Features

- Communicate with the Editor SDK mod for Hitman 3 for a loaded mission to get collision (ALOC) hashes and transforms, and Pathfinder box transforms and save them to files
- Extract the ALOC files using [`rpkg-rs`](https://github.com/dafitius/rpkg-rs)
